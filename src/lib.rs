//! #spin-locks
//! An Intel hardware-optimized spin lock that uses Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) and a non-CAS based spin lock (an OR lock) as a fast fallback.
//! The intel spin lock, `IntelTsxHleSpinLock`, is only available on x86 and x86_64 targets.
//! To pick the best spin lock for the compilation target, use the type alias `BestSpinLockForCompilationTarget`.
//!
